    What is Abstraction1?
    Abstraction1 is the process of hiding the implementation details
    and showing only the functionality to the user.

    How to achieve Abstraction1?
    1.Abstract class(0 to 100%)
    2.Interface(Achieve 100% abstraction)


    Points:
    1.Abstract method has no body.
    2.It must be ends with a semicolon.
    3.It must be in the abstract class.
    4.It must be overridden.
    5.It can never be final and static.

    Abstract Class:
    1.Abstract class have abstract and non-abstract method.(concrete method)
    2.Non-abstract class can't have abstract method.

    .Abstract class: abstract class A{}
    .Abstract class can't be instantiated.
    .If you extend an abstract class you have to use all its abstract methods
     or you have to declare the class as Abstract itself. */
